# Implement Disk Scheduling Algorithms

## Overview
This project implements and compares classic disk scheduling algorithms used by operating systems to optimize disk I/O performance.

## Algorithms Implemented
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- SCAN
- C-SCAN
- LOOK / C-LOOK (if applicable)

## Key Concepts
- Disk seek time optimization
- Scheduling trade-offs
- Throughput vs fairness

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of OS disk scheduling
- Algorithm comparison and performance analysis
